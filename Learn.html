    <h1>So you want to learn photography</h1>
    <p>
      You probably saw some really cool post on pintrest or instagram, maybe you were in a hipster
      coffee shop and noticed the crazy art of another photographer. Well before you quit your job, sell
      your house and invest all your money into $50,000 of gear, here are some tips for
      when you start.
    </p>
    <h2>Where to Get Started</h2>
    <p>
      Okay so maybe you did end up selling everything you own for this photography passion... well
      it's time to get started! First things first you'll need to find out where you want to start.
      You're going to need some gear. I would highly recommend that you do not
      head on down to your local Best Buy and pick up the most expensive camera they have (if you
      have already done this don't stress it, Best Buy takes returns). If you did not buy a camera
      already then your doing great. If you have a smart phone, start with that. If you don't have
      a smartphone, I'd first like to say that I am impressed that you have a computer and not a
      smartphone, and second that you should go out and buy a small digital camera. Smartphones and
      digital cameras are an amazing place to start for people just getting into photography. <br><br>
      If you already have a little bit of experience using digital cameras and smartphones then it's
      time to branch out to the <b>digital single-lens reflex cameras</b>(DSLR). Although that word might seem
      intimidating don't worry!... the actual camera is a lot more intimidating! DSLRs are the next step
      in improving your photography. They offer loads more accessibility to your settings and shooting
      abilities, plus they look cooler. If you're not sure what DSLR to buy (or to lazy to do the research)
      then head over to the Gear Pages and I have some listed out ;).
    </p>
    <h2>Learning to Shoot</h2>
    <p>
      I'd like to preface this paragraph with a little note, you will never <b><i>learn to shoot</b></i>.
      Photography is like most other passions, a constant learning experience. Every time you think
      you know everything you'll find something new. So if you ever worry that your photos arent good
      enough, or someone else can shoot better than you, know that the journey to better photos is always
      up, you can't unlearn knowledge. <br><br>
      Okay, so now that that's out of the way lets talk about taking lessons. <b><i>Don't</b></i>. Yep
      you heard it from a guy who has taken many lessons. Everything I have learned in every lesson,
      class, lecture, I could have learned on my own. Save your money and time and pick up a photography
      book or watch some Youtube photography lessons.
