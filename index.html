      <font size="20">Anyone</font> who owns a camera can say they are a photographer,
        this term is used to define a wide variety of different individuals so
         I am going to help describe what it means to me. I seek to find the
         hidden gems of this world and share them with those around me, I seek
         to take the beauty in this world and capture it using a machine and
         that is why I call myself a photographer. The photos that I take are
         what I find to be inspirational, in a strange sense they tend to be
         what my definition of beauty is. My whole purpose with my photography
         is to help others and myself see the world through a different lens
         *ba dum tss*. But in all seriousness I seek to help others see what
         I am able to see, the beauty of this creation.

    <p class="p1">
      <font size="20">Although</font> the generational spectrum defines me as a Millennial, I am
      actually on the cutting edge being part of the Silent Generation.
      And I think that label more accurately describes me.  I am more comfortable
      behind the lens of a camera than in front of a crowd; I would rather read
      dystopian fiction in a Starbucks on a Friday night than attend a disco
      dance at the local club. In full honesty I probably wouldn’t even
      be at the Starbucks – way to much money for a cup of coffee.  My
      personal favorite places to be, and where I feel at home, is either
      out in the wilderness exploring creation with a camera or behind a
      computer practicing my coding skills. Yes I am a programmer, I am
      currently studying computer science and am in my Junior year (this
      website in fact is a personal project). When given the opportunity
      to be outside in nature I will almost always take it. I fell in love
      with the sounds and smells of the wildlife of the forests. Animals are
      one of my favorite things to discover and watch.

      <font size="20">I</font> began my photography Journey at the age of 14 with a
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical/dp/B00RKNND2W/ref=sr_1_4?gclid=CjwKCAjwg-DpBRBbEiwAEV1_-JXcVD40JKXN_7NnUT7zPrBUIa-iaDgZmXlGDijbmiR-6eZOcYkvFxoCDywQAvD_BwE&hvadid=267948241337&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9013195&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=e&hvrand=8935528701216097773&hvtargid=aud-676677759484%3Akwd-472476054455&hydadcr=18472_9830788&keywords=canon-powershot-sx530&qid=1563991588&s=gateway&sr=8-4">
      Canon PowerShot</a>
      (I had a model much earlier than this one, it was much cheaper when I
      got it). In full honesty looking back that camera was a piece of trash,
      but it got me hooked, so I can never have enough thanks for it. I got
      the camera because my family told me that we were taking a vactation
      to Hawaii and I wanted to get the best shots of this adventure. Mind
      you this was before every single phone took high quality photos, this
      was back when you could buy a camera with 25 shots on it from your local
      CVS. I will admit that taking my first photos with this camera was
      extremely discouraging, the photos looked terrible and the camera was
      confusing, every photographer I talked to said that my issue was that
      I was using a digital camera and not a DSLR, so that didn’t help my
      discouragement. Looking back now I realize it wasn’t the camera or my
      abilities, taking a couple of hundred of bad photos is the learning process.
    </p>
    <p class="p1">
      <font size="20">Eventually</font> after practicing a lot with the PowerShot, and I was getting
      quite good with it, I decided to make the jump to a DSLR. I made this
      choice due to another trip I was going on outside of the country. I looked
      around for a long time for the perfect camera, and if you have done
      this before you know how stupid I probably looked. I had absolutely no
      idea what ISO, Shutter Speed, Aperture f-Stop meant, so I did what any
      logical individual human would do when they don’t know something… act
      like I know it all. After a lot of article reading and speaking with
      best buy employees I settled on a bundle for the Nikon D3300. Some of
      you Canon fans out there probably think I’m a traitor for switching
      from the PowerShot to a Nikon, but for all those out there deciding
      on which brand to get this is all I have to say, it doesn’t make a difference!
      I’ll expand on this in the learn page.

    <p class="p1">
      <font size="20">Finally,</font> the camera arrived, I was overwhelmed with excitement and confusion.
      I had no idea how to use this camera. Even though I was confused I still took
      the camera with me outside the country and practiced a ton. To sum up the rest
      of my experience with a DSLR I can say that practice and google will help make
      anyone a better photographer. I have now been shooting for almost 8 years and
      I adore it. With time and practice photography gets so much better, the photos
      never stop improving from the previous ones and there are always more stunning
      things to photograph in this world.
